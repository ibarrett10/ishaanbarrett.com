  <div class="about-content">
    <p class="about-intro">
      I am a current Senior at Columbia University, majoring in Political Science and Urban Studies.
      Originally from Washington, DC, I attended the Maret School before moving to New York for college.
    </p>

    <div class="about-body">
      <p>
        My research broadly engages with questions in architectural theory, economics, public policy, and
        urban affairs. My <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">previous work</a> centers on
        contemporary urbanism in DC and New York; mayoral governance in New York City; architectural design
        and urban planning; and public policy analysis and immigration law.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been featured in the <em>New York Review of Architecture</em> and published in
        <em>URBAN</em> magazine at Columbia University GSAPP, the <em>Harvard Urban Review</em>, the
        <em>Columbia Policy Journal</em>, <em>Pidgin Magazine</em> at the Princeton School of Architecture,
        <em>PLATFORM</em>, and <em>The Barnard-Columbia Urban Review</em>, of which I was the former
        Editor-In-Chief. I am the former President of Columbia Global Research and Consulting, a social
        impact consulting group at Columbia University that works with nonprofits around the world,
        concentrating on government, education, and public health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I <a href="{{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}">work</a> as a Columnist for the <em>Columbia Political Review</em> (CPR)
        and formerly wrote a column at the <em>Columbia Daily Spectator</em>. My work at <em>Spectator</em> has been featured
        in the Alex Wagner Podcast "Trumpland" on MSNBC. I have previously held positions at the New York Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA), 
        FTI Consulting, and have been selected for numerous competitive research fellowships within and beyond Columbia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I serve as the Founder and Principal of the
        <a href="http://urbanequityinstitute.org">Urban Equity Institute</a> (UEI), a close-knit global
        think tank dedicated to tackling pressing, interdisciplinary social issues through innovative
        research. At UEI, I am also the Co-Director of the
        <a href="https://www.urbanequityinstitute.org/democracy-and-public-policy-practice/">Democracy and Public Policy Practice</a>
        (DPP), which leads policy work and research on democratic governance and policy reform. I also
        co-direct UEI's
        <a href="https://www.urbanequityinstitute.org/city-governance-and-policy-practice/">Policy Intelligence Lab (PI-Lab)</a>
        that develops public sector scholarship using Machine Learning and AI-assisted research.
